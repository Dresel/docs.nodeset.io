# Introduction

[StakeWise](https://docs.stakewise.io/) is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with a highly flexible, vault-based architecture. Staking providers may create public or private vaults, set their own fee levels, and issue a unique liquid staking token. Depositors may select a staking provider directly or spread their assets across a large variety of vaults using the native osETH token. This flexibility makes it an ideal foundation for protocols which need direct visibility and immediate access to the underlying collateral.

NodeSet provides StakeWise vault administrators with a reliable service solution, enabling novel LSTfi products which are safer and more efficient than ever before.
