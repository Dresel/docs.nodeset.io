# Introduction

[StakeWise](https://docs.stakewise.io/) is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with a highly flexible, vault-based architecture.  Staking providers may create public or private vaults, set their own fee levels, and issue a unique liquid staking token. Depositors may select a staking provider directly or spread their assets across a large variety of vaults using the native osETH token.

NodeSet provides StakeWise vault administrators with a reliable service partnership, enabling novel LSTfi products which are more efficient than ever before.
