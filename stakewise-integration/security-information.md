# Security Information

### Audits

The StakeWise v3 contracts are audited by leading independent security professionals. Please see [the reports in their repository](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits) for more information.

The StakeWise integration uses a [Splits](https://splits.org/) contract for rewarding NOs, and these contracts have also been [audited by independent researchers](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-contracts/blob/main/audit/0xSplits\_A-1.pdf).

### Bug Bounties

The NodeSet StakeWise integration is not covered by a bug bounty program specifically. Instead, the [NodeSet Dashboard bug bounty program](../nodeset-dashboard/security-information.md#bug-bounties) also covers any issues related to StakeWise.
