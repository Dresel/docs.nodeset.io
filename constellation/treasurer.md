# Treasurer

To better fit the real-world separation of responsibilities between fee owners and service providers, there is a role that specifically exists to manage protocol-wide revenues generated by xrETH and xRPL: the Treasurer.&#x20;

From a smart contract perspective, the Treasurer is simply an address which receives these revenues. Its only other capability is to change the current Treasurer address to point to another address.

This role allows Constellation to fit many different types of organizational architectures. For example, the Administrator may be one segment of a DAO made up of the systemâ€™s Operators, and the Treasurer could be a secondary element of the same DAO that is responsible for protocol-wide incentives or marketing. Ultimately, the flexibility afforded by the separation of Administration, node operation, and collective fee aggregation makes Constellation a better foundation for any kind of second-layer staking project on Rocket Pool, strengthening its value as a public good.
