# Client Diversity Policy

NodeSet understands that [client diversity is _**NOT**_ optional -- it's critical.](https://clientdiversity.org/#why) To ensure Ethereum remains a safe base layer for value transfer, node operators must exercise discretion when designing their setup to maximize chain resilience. NodeSet does not wish to simply contribute to the network; our community should contribute **positively**.&#x20;

It is currently impossible to prove the software which operators are using, so all metrics are self-reported. **While NodeSet ultimately cannot control how operators choose to set up their nodes, w**e **strongly encourage** **users of majority clients to switch to a minority client.** This is an easy process, and our community and team can provide support with this.
