# Applications

Node operators may apply to join NodeSet at [http://nodeset.io/join](http://nodeset.io/join)

Even if you don't meet the requirements listed below, **you can still apply!** We reprocess applications on a regular basis, usually every two weeks. This means you may apply even if you don't meet the criteria (or if you are unsure). We will contact you to let you know the initial status of the application and then again if/when your status changes.

### Acceptance Requirements

1. Operators must maintain at least one solo validator, Rocket Pool validator, or a validator on behalf of another staking protocol/business. This validator must have at least 6 months of continuous operation with a minimum effectiveness rating of 95% over the most recent 90 days.
2. Operators must supply NodeSet with a disaster recovery plan.
3. Operators must pass a live video interview with questions regarding your ability to troubleshoot issues and maintain a node
4. NodeSet will conduct additional manual sybil checks. Further details are not public to preserve the security of this process.
5. Operators must agree to Terms of Service for each service for which they operate.

### Operational Requirements

1. Sufficiently powerful computer hardware to run 50-100 validators with exceptional performance, including future considerations for network upgrades such as EIP-4484 or restaking.
2. Robust monitoring system (e.g. Prometheus + Grafana)
3. Automated notifications from [Beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in) or a similar service
4. Remote SSH connection for troubleshooting when away from home (e.g. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/))
5. [Rescue Node](https://rescuenode.com/) utilization during pruning (if necessary)
